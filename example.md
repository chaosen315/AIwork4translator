Program

Is your life unrewarding? Do you need some excitement? Mr A-MAAAAAAZE here with the solution to your life troubles. Your problem is that you just aren’t reward- ing yourself enough, friend! You are the one doing the work, after all! You deserve so much more than what you are giving yourself.

It’s  clear  to  me  that  you  have  got  to treat yourself better. No, not by going to therapy. Give yourself something you really need! Material goods that will keep you smiling even on rainy days. Ah, but therein lies the real problem, choomba.

When you try to buy yourself a well-de- served reward, you always know exactly what you’re gonna get. Where is the sur- prise, the excitement of the unknown, the thrill, in that? I’ll tell you where. It’s in one of my A-MAAAAAA-ZING Mystery Boxes. Inside each of my bespoke hand-packed upcycled biodegradable plastic mystery cubes you’ll find a delightful object to keep those expensive trips to the therapist to a minimum.

Best  of  all,  when  you  sign  up  for  my M.R.A.M.A.Z.E. Program, we’ll give you one whenever you deserve it, just like magic. So come on down to Dock 13 in sunny South Night City, and celebrate all your future achievements the right way - with surprise mechanics!

Mr. Amaze Your Friendly South Night City Fixer

What is This?

Achievements  and  Loot  Boxes  is  an optional new subsystem to enhance your Cyberpunk  RED  campaign  by  intro- ducing a quirky combination of surprise mechanics and luck to what can sometimes be an overly grimdark cyberfuture.

Heck, we just released a book with the word Black in the title. It’s time to swing that pendulum back, party people.

How Do I Use It?

Using  Achievements  and  Loot  Boxes  is easy! Achievements are earned by your Crew  as  a  one-time  currency  the  first time a Player Characters (or occasion- ally the Player themself) meets one of the Achievement’s requirements, as arbitrated and  decided  upon  by  the  GM.  Each Achievement can only be earned once per Crew.

Once an Achievement is earned, it can be traded in anytime, without an Action, via a unanimous group decision for one of the following two effects:

1.  Reroll a single d10 rolled by one of the Players after the die has been cast and keep the higher outcome of the two rolls. This must be done before the GM announces the outcome and cannot be used on Death Saves.

2.  Receive one of Mr. Amaze’s Mystery Boxes.  When  redeemed,  roll  1d10 on  The  Table  of  Mystery  to  deter- mine  which  box  the  Crew  receives. Then, when the box is opened as an Action, roll 1d6 on that box’s table to determine its contents. Weapons that come  fully  loaded  are  loaded  with whatever ammunition the GM desires. Mr. Amaze’s Mystery Boxes instantly appear within 10 m/yards of one of the Edgerunners in a location no member of the Crew is currently observing. The appearance of a Mystery Box makes no sound and they can appear any- where, even in the vacuum of space. If you get an item marked with an asterisk, don’t panic, it’s from Black Chrome, our awesome new tech and style guide for Cyberpunk RED. If you don’t have Black Chrome, just replace it with an item of equivalent value. We’ve also included plenty of items from the Free DLCs always available on our website in the downloads section, so keep your Agent handy.
